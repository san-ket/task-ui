# Frontend Task UI

This is built on the top of create-react-app.

## Installing / Getting started

##### Install dependencies

```
1. yarn install  ( This will install dependancies for both server and client!)
```

##### Run the application

```
2. yarn start
```

### Prerequisites

- node >= 8
- npm >= 5

I have tried to add most of the features without using additional libraries.
